A medical advisory mobile application for middle and lower class income bracket.

We wanted to create a product that could help bridge the health gap between the upper class, the middle and the lower class by creating a platform that will help bring awareness to natural remedies that would help with common illnesses do not require immediate medical attention as something as simple as a common cold could be cured with resources oranges, steam inhaling,that are available to people in the income bracket  without necessarily spending so much on drugs on these more common issues
